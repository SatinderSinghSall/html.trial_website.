            I Satinder Singh Sall, a student of Computer Science at REVA University, Bangalore have created this website.
            Currently, I am learning the Web. Development on Udemy of Dr Angela Yu's course, she is a Developer and Lead
            Instructor at the London App Brewery, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. The motto of creating this
            website is to help each other in the process of learning Computer Science. We will help each other step by step
            so that each one of us will understand the concept and implement that in their learning process. We will not just
            limit our discussion only on the Web. Dev. Rather we will try to help each other in every aspect of Computer Science.
             For this thing to happen I need your help and support. <br /> 
        
            <h4> Let us be open mined and help each other in the process of learning. <br /> </h4> 

            I will thereby attached a link for the community to join, by just clicking on that
